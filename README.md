# DLSiteGameManager

First of all its not my work just releasing it here to work better with it.

Original can be found here: https://ulmf.org/threads/dlsite-game-manager-0-3-3.6298/

The Mod is from here: https://ulmf.org/threads/dlsite-game-manager-0-3-3.6298/page-7#post-685603

The coded bases on the Version v.0.46 of the Mod with the fix for the new Tags and Categories of DLSite from here: 
https://ulmf.org/threads/dlsite-game-manager-0-3-3.6298/page-12#post-1187399

v33.46.3:
Fixed the Rename/Organize by template so it will move files from other Drives to the Main Game Folder and 
even Organize when no RJCode is in the filename but in the Info.
